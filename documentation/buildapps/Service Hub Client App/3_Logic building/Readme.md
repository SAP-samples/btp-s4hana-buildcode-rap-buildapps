# Module 3 - Unit 1_3: Logic building 

1. You can see that each input field in the form that you imported using template application has a value that is already bounded. Here is an example for the first input field (Title) is bounded to Incidents1.title. That means, the value of the title will be saved into this data variable after user`s input

2. Now, we will configure the logic for the button at the end of this form. So that, user can create a new incident by clicking it. Select the button and open the logic editor tab from the bottom of your page.

3. LetÂ´s check the preconfigured logic to understand the whole process. Once the component (button) is tapped, a spinner will be shown to user to notify them the record creation process has started. Here the spinner will also show a text that can be adjusted by the developer: Incident is being created

> After create record process is successfuly completed, the spinner will be hiden. Therefore, "Hide Spinner" component is connected to the first node* of "Create Record" component. A Popup window will be shown to user via Alert logic component.

> *First nodes are always the success node for logic components in SAP Build Apps while the second nodes are the fail nodes. If there are 3 nodes for the logic component, third nodes are the fail nodes.

34.  We want to see a blank form after the incident is created. To do that, click on the last logic component called Set Data Variable and click on the X icon under data variable name to select one

35. Select Incidents1 and Save it

![](../screenshots/Picture60.png)

36. Click on Custom object

![](../screenshots/Picture61.png)

37. Here you can see that none of the data fields has a value. That means, the user input data will be removed after the incident is submitted by the user. You can simply close this window.
