# Mastering SAP S/4HANA Extension with SAP Build, SAP Build Code and SAP BTP ABAP 

## Description
This scenario showcases the integration of a mobile app developed using SAP Build Apps with two backend services: SAP Build Code with Joule(CAP) and Restful ABAP Programming(RAP). The mobile app, created with a no-code approach, interacts seamlessly with CAP and RAP backends service, offering advanced functionalities and data access.

1. Suzan, a dedicated medical technician at SBA Medical clinic,, diligently inspected the vital equipment ensuring the highest standards of patient care. As she meticulously examined each device, her keen eye caught a minor glitch in one of the medical instruments.

2. Without hesitation, Suzan reached for her trusted companion in the digital realm â€“ the Service Hub mobile app. With swift taps on her smartphone screen, she raised an incident report detailing the issue encountered with the medical equipment.

3. Meanwhile, in the heart of the digital infrastructure, the Cloud Application Programming (CAP) application, powered with Joule, seamlessly sprang into action. The incident reported by Suzan was swiftly captured and recorded within the CAP application, ensuring a centralized repository for all service-related matters.

4. As the incident popped up on the radar of the Service Hub Admin, Alex, the seasoned service manager at Heath Tech Devices, took charge. With a few deft clicks within the Service Hub Admin interface, Alex assessed the incident, evaluated its priority level, and swiftly assigned a proficient processor to address the issue.

5. In the background, the robust Restful ABAP Programming (RAP) application, built using the Business Technology Platform (BTP) ABAP environment, came into play. Leveraging its capabilities, RAP seamlessly calculated the precise geographical location of the assigned processor by fetching latitude and longitude details from the CAP system.

6. Armed with this vital geo-location information, Suzan could now track the progress of the assigned processor in real-time. With a sense of reassurance, she monitored the processor's journey and estimated arrival time, ensuring minimal disruption to the clinic's operations.
