# Mastering SAP S/4HANA Extension with SAP Build, SAP Build Code and SAP BTP ABAP 
[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/btp-s4hana-buildcode-rap-buildapps)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/btp-s4hana-buildcode-rap-buildapps)
## Description
This scenario showcases the integration of a mobile application developed using SAP Build Apps with two backend services: SAP Build Code with Joule (CAP) and ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP). The mobile application, created with a no-code approach, interacts seamlessly with CAP and RAP backend services, offering advanced functionalities and data access.

1. Suzan, a dedicated medical technician at SBA Medical clinic, diligently inspected the vital equipment ensuring the highest standards of patient care. As she meticulously examined each device, her keen eye caught a minor glitch in one of the medical instruments.

2. Without hesitation, Suzan reached for her trusted companion in the digital realm â€“ the Service Hub mobile application. With swift taps on her smartphone screen, she raised an incident report detailing the issue encountered in the medical equipment.

3. Meanwhile, in the heart of the digital infrastructure, the application developed with the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP), powered with Joule, seamlessly sprang into action. The incident reported by Suzan was swiftly captured and recorded within the CAP application, ensuring a centralized repository for all service-related matters.

4. As the incident popped up on the radar of Alex, the Service Hub Admin, the seasoned service manager at Heath Tech Devices, took charge. With a few deft clicks within the Service Hub Admin interface, Alex assessed the incident, evaluated its priority level, and swiftly assigned a proficient processor to address the issue.

5. In the background, the application developed with the ABAP RESTful application programming model (RAP), built using the SAP BTP, ABAP environment, came into play. Leveraging its capabilities, the RAP application seamlessly calculated the precise geographical location of the assigned processor by fetching latitude and longitude details from the CAP application.

6. Armed with this vital geo-location information, Suzan could now track the progress of the assigned processor in real-time. With a sense of reassurance, she monitored the processor's journey and estimated the arrival time, ensuring minimal disruption to the clinic's operations.
